title: About Megalyfe

<div class="trial-class">
  <p>Megalyfe started off as an idea that achieving complete fitness should neither be painstaking nor time-consuming. I believe that the journey to good health and a good body can be fun, exhilarating, exciting and more than anything else, deeply satisfying.</p>

<p>Since I started Megalyfe, I’ve had the honour of working with individuals, who for several years, have battled problems like fatigue syndrome, back pain, weight gain, joint pain and poor immunity to name a few. It’s always a joy when I work with them and see them, eventually realise the potential of their body to heal itself, become leaner and stronger, like a finely tuned instrument. This in fact is the best end goal to have. Aim for achieving ultimate strength, endurance and exquisite muscle definition, rather than weight loss alone.</p>

<p>I hope your journey begins here and leads you to where you see yourself in the near future.</p>
